The only difference is that Newton's method uses the tangent line while the secant method uses the secant line. Because of of that Newton's method requires only 1 point in the domain to be guessed to start the algorithm, while the secant method requires 2 points in the domain to be guessed.\n","Normally the Newton method ususally converges faster than the secant method. Newton method converges quadratically, while the secant method linearly. This means that with each iteration the error between the approximation and the actual solution decreases at a contstant rate for secant method vs decreasing at a rate that's proportional to the squared error from the previous iteration for newton's.\n","\n","Due to the difference in lines being used in each algorithm, newtons method is faster, but requires higher-order information (derivative) compared to the slower secant method that uses a secant line.\n","\n","P.S. Evidently the bisection algorithm takes much longer (more iterations) to converge to the root compared to newtons or secant method."],"metadata":{"id":"wu3McwRZ-PqC"}}]}
